# Service

The Service executes the predefined tasks when accessed externally.
In many cases, it will be accessed via the POST method.

The Service can use the Modules.

The Service should run without a system (not as much as a module).

As with the modules, if system configuration is required, the Service can load the configuration script `ContentsPlanet.php`.
